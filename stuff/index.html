Ok, you old <A href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113957/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Netizen</A>, you. You've found my dumping ground for all the old stuff I've got hanging round with 
nowhere to go. Can't guarantee any of the links will work.

<UL>
<LI>Not my first webpage, but the oldest one I've still got: <A href="old/andrewe.htm">1995 homepage</A>. Can't say my research interests have changed any.</LI>
<LI>Three posters I wrote for the web back in 1995:
<UL>
<LI><A href="old/poster1.htm">Ploughing And Lodgement Of A Clast</A></LI>
<LI><A href="old/poster2.htm">A Use of Microstructures for Environmental Reconstruction</A></LI>
<LI><A href="old/andysemi.htm">The Causes and Effects of Microstructures</A></LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Old Java Applet I wrote to replicate the Pascal model in my <A href="https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?did=1&uin=uk.bl.ethos.367930">PhD</A>: <A href="plough/index.html">Clast Ploughing</A></LI>
<LI>Daft <A href="robots/coward.html">Robocode team</A> I used to use to compete with my Java students.</LI>
<LI>A Java environmental <A href="dye/dye.html">dye dispirsal calculator</A> I wrote for a PhD student back in 1998.</LI>
<LI>A collation of quotes on <A href="situationist/psychogeog.html">Psychogeography and the d&eacute;rive</A> I pulled together in 1998, for a while one of the few sources on psychogeography online. It came with 
a map to use when exploring the web.</LI>
