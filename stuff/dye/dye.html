<H4>Help...</H4>
<P>
This page calculates the rate of dispirsion of a cloud 
of dye as it travels through a water system. 'Time one' is 
the time to reach half the peak value in minutes, 'time two' is the 
time for it to fall back to half the peak value after the 
peak has passed. The output includes the estimate of the 
peak time and the dispersion coefficient.
<P>
The coefficient is calculated by iteratively using 
times for the peak event between times one and two. 
This time is placed into the equations for dispersion, 
one of which has 'time one' as a constant, the other 
'time two'. The true values of the coeff and estimated 
peak time will occur when the iterated peak time 
gives the same value for the coeff in both equations.<p> 
This is highly unlikely to occur, so there is a tolerance 
function, which is the amount the coeff is allowed to vary 
either side of one of the equation's values before it 
is equal to the other's value. Essentially this sets the 
decimal places to which the coeff is accurate.<p>
The spacing of the time iterations will also effect the 
values. 
There are two calculating options. 
<OL>
<LI> Calculate all the values of the coeff that fall
 within the tolerance limits for time iterations of a 
given value. The page won't bother displaying these values 
if there are more that 300. For a well known spreadsheet 
equivalent of this page, the time iteration is about '3'.
I'd stick with the defaults if you are not sure. Use this 
option if you don't like the optimiser and want to get 
multiple values to average.
<LI> Optimise by time and toleration. This option should 
usually reduce the figures to one optimal set. Extra data 
is optimised away by first reducing the time increments 
to smaller and smaller levels until the tolerance takes over as 
the controlling factor or we can't get more accurate 
coeffs for this tolerance, then the tolerance is iteratively 
reduced. While 
this procedure is a pretty cack-handed way of finding a solution 
to the equations, it'll do for now, given the levels of 
accuracy inherent in the measurements.
</OL>
<P>
The other checkbox allows you to examine the dispersion coeffs 
as they are being calculated. This is just so you can check 
the system is doing something rather than hanging. Be warned 
that this option massively increases the time for the 
calculations and you may need to occasionally clear the 
java console as it fills up and hangs on some browsers.
<P>
I'd also recommend you run this page in a new browser window 
which you can kill if the page hangs. That way you shouldn't 
have to restart your browser.
<P>
If you want a copy of the source code, this page, and the 
java classes so you can run this off line, here's a 
<A HREF="dye.zip">zip file</A> with them in. If you want further 
information, email <A HREF="http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/staff/a.evans/">Andy Evans</A> on 
<A HREF="MAILTO:geoaje@leeds.ac.uk">geoaje@leeds.ac.uk</A>. If you improve the 
code, let me know and I'll update it!
