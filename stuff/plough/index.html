<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>
<STRONG>The applet below ploughs rocks (clasts) trapped in 
a glacier bed into a virtual slope of mud (till) until they stick in the 
slope (achieve lodgement). At the same time, it calculates 
the amount of ice that melts because of pressure on the 
rock, the force applied to the rock by the ice, and 
the length the clast travels.</STRONG></P> 
<P>
This program is a development of that used in 
<A href="/projects/a.evans/">Evans (1998)</A>, please see chapter five of 
that work for a full explaination, though note the differences outlined below. 
For further information, please contact <A href="/people/a.evans/">Andy Evans</A>.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG><A onClick="Alakazam();"><U>Launch applet in new window</U></A> (may take a short while to appear)</STRONG>
</P> 
<P>
The program runs in two modes. In the first, a single 
clast is ploughed into a slope using a given ice speed and 
till residual strength. In this mode the characteristics of 
the ploughing process are given for each day the ploughing occurs 
allowing a picture to be built up, for example, of the amount of 
sediment melting out of the ice at each point on the 
ploughing gouge.
</P>

<P>
In the second mode, a ploughing length is given, and various 
combinations of ice velocity and till residual strength are 
tried to see if they can produce the given ploughing length. 
If they can, a set of characteristics for the ploughing 
event are given, for example, the total amount of sediment 
melted out of the ice.
</P>
 
<P>
<STRONG>The applet can also be run as an application. If run 
as an application it allows you to specify an output file, which 
considerably speeds up runs.</STRONG>
</P>
<P>
If you run the program as an applet, you can still get results 
by using <KBD>ctrl-x</KBD> to copy the highlighted results 
from the applet.
</P>
<P>
To run the program as an application, download the file 
<A href="plough.jar">plough.jar</A> and double-click on it 
in whatever file manager you use (e.g. Windows Explorer). 
If the program doesn't run, you'll need to install the 
JRE (this is installed on most machines 
already). You can find a copy at 
<A href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html">Sun</A>.

<H4>General parameters</H4>

<DL>

<DT>Inflow percentage</DT>
<DD>As the clast ploughs, it gouges through the till. This option 
allows you to set some percentage of the material gouged out of the 
way to flow back into the gouge.</DD>

<DT>Clast Width</DT>
<DD>This is the clast length in the direction of ploughing and 
also the length transfer to this.</DD>

<DT>Clast Height</DT>
<DD>The vertical length of the clast.</DD>

<DT>Slope the clast ploughes into</DT>
<DD>This is the slope angle in degrees. It could be 
used to indicate prow buildup, but the physics of 
this is less certain than that of ploughing into a slope.</DD>

<DT>Initial debris fraction</DT>
<DD>This is the amount, in kg, of sediment released from the ice 
by the melting of 1kg of water. Note that this is not quite the 
same thing as the ratio of sediment to water in the ice.</DD>

<DT>Till internal friction</DT>
<DD>The angle of internal friction of the till. 22 degrees is 
appropriate for a silt-clay mix with some sand.</DD>

</DL>

<H4>Buttons</H4>

<DL>

<DT>Switch Modes</DT>
<DD>This button allows you to switch between the 
two modes described above.</DD>

<DT>Calculate for one speed/strength / Calculate for all speeds/strengths</DT>
<DD>Runs the program. As a minimum the program will tell you it's 
started and finished.</DD>

<DT>Clear screen</DT>
<DD>Clears the screen of results and messages.</DD>

<DT>Set output to file</DT>
<DD>This only appears if the program is run as an application. It 
allows you to divert results to a text file, rather than the screen. 
A few messages from the system are still shown on the screen.</DD>

</DL>

<H4>Parameters for testing a single plough event</H4>

<DL>

<DT>Till residual strength</DT>
<DD>The residual strength or residual supported stress of 
the till. This is the amount of stress the till can support 
after it has yielded. It is assumed in this model that 
the yield strength is zero.</DD>

<DT>Initial ice velocity</DT>
<DD>The ice velocity in metres per year.</DD>


</DL>

<H4>Parameters for testing a multiple ice velocities / till strengths</H4>

<DL>

<DT>Starting velocity / Ending velocity / Step between velocities</DT>
<DD>Allows you to set up the first and last velocities to try. The 
program will step between the two at a rate determined by the step 
value. Each velocity will be tried to see if it produces the 
requested ploughing length.</DD>

<DT>Starting till strength / Ending till strength / Step between strengths</DT>
<DD>Allows you to set up the first and last till strengths to try. The 
program will step between the two at a rate determined by the step 
value. Each till strength will be tried to see if it produces the 
requested ploughing length.</DD>


<DT>Minimum ploughed length / Maximum ploughed length</DT>
<DD>Allows you to set a length the clast can plough. The 
lengths between and including these two figures will 
be looked for as the program tries various ice velocities and 
till strengths. Any combinations that produce a length between 
these two will be saved.</DD>

</DL>

<H3>Changes from Evans, 1998</H3>

<UL>
<LI>The distribution of the meltout sediment has changed.</LI> 
<LI>The velocity difference between the clast and the ice are 
now used as the lodgement criteria, not the drag force.</LI>
</UL>
