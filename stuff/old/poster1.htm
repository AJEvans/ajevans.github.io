<H3>Introduction</H3>



The glacial history of the Lleyn Peninsular, North Wales, is

still a matter of some controversy. It is unclear whether there are

sediments from one or two glaciations preserved in the area. <A HREF="#ref">Saunders (1968)</A> suggested that two glaciers over-rode the area depositing two tills. <A HREF="#ref">Boulton (1977)</A> has suggested in the East of the peninsula that the upper of the two diamicts is a meltout-then-flow till associated with the ice depositing the lower till. In the West of the area diamicts and gravels / sands have been variously interpreted as glaciomarine <A HREF="#ref">(Eyles and McCabe, 1989)</A> and flow tills (<A HREF="#ref">McCarroll and Harris, 1992</A>). A small number of

preliminary samples were taken to assess thin sectioning techniques, and

these were selected from interesting features of several deposits on the

peninsula so as to serve a dual purpose. This study looks at a deposit

close to that studied by Boulton near Criccieth, in particular looking at

one section of the boundary between the 'flow' till and the lodgement till

beneath. It is suggested that the unusual feature sampled at this boundary

was formed in the late stages of clast lodgement into the lower till and

that it may throw some light on both the history of the area and the

mechanism of large clast deposition.<P>



<H3>Location of Samples</H3>



Samples were taken from a hillock of till on the East side of Criccieth,

between the town and the sea caves (SH 508382). The mound has been described

elsewhere as a 'drumlin' purely on the basis of its form. Samples were taken from an area of alternating blue and yellow silts and small (<5cm) iron stained sand lenses on the lower till side of the boundary between two proposed glaciogenic diamicts. The mixed sediment zone extended some 2m and was ~50cm high. It was associated with a boulder to the immediate West and a resistant band in the lodgement till 20cm beneath which extended some 15m East. A landslip made mapping to the West hard, but immediately West of the boulder the blue till left the top of the erratic and fell West. This suggests the feature does not extend to the West of the boulder. Regionally the ice moved East to West, though the deposit is at the head of two North - South valleys which may have contained small glaciers.<P>

<A NAME="analy">

<H3>Analysis</H3>



Two thin sections were prepared from the zone, unfortunately these were

from only one (West-East) plane. The sections showed that the alternating

banding was the result of interbedding of three sedimentary types -<P>

<UL>

<LI>A sand (ave ~0.3mm) of schistose material, probably local rock. This

     was found in bands with clean pores constituting some 45% of the

     sediment.

<LI>A melange of silts of various sizes and deformations, with blocks

     separated by deformed silts of various sizes (mode 0.01mm but all

     sizes including some clays). These formed the blue and yellow bands

     seen in hand-samples.

<LI>Quartz grains (~0.1mm) in masses and between, and included in, other

     beds.

</UL>

There were no boundaries found between the different bodies which were

shear zones and in places the boundaries were erosional. This suggests

deposition was by flow. In places there was simple shear where boundary

irregularities produced friction and in other places fabrics could be seen

moving into the topography of lower sediment bodies.<P>



The sediment bodies were deposited in consistent relationships. The sands

were deposited in bands with little or no silt in the pore spaces, suggesting the flow of clean water. They were also weakly aligned

horizontally. In the one place the sands were overridden by silts they were

mixed together in a 4.3mm zone. In places in this zone slugs of silt were

armoured with sand grains suggesting the edge of flow units.

While it was impossible to determine the true flow direction of these

features it was apparent from associated extensional features and folding

that they did not flow West - East.<P>



The quartz grains were found throughout all the other bodies except the

sands, suggesting they may have winnowed out of these in a water body. The

grains were prevalent at body boundaries suggesting fallout deposition

between events. However, they also formed units of just

quartz which moved with the surrounding flows and filled veins.<P>



The silts were found in three types of bodies...<P>

<UL>

<LI>'Typical' melanges consisting of blocks of coherent sediment

     surrounded by deformed material. Neither the blocks nor

     the 'matrix' were of one specific silt size. The rotated and varying

     fabrics in these bodies suggest the material did not suffer glacial

     consolidation after deposition.

<LI>Flow bodies with a unidirectional internal fabric in which coarse

     grained areas, probably flow incorporated quartz, were extended by

     simple shear between flow bodies.

<LI>Graded beds in lenses with sharp boundaries between the coarse

     material of one lens and the fine material of the one above. The fine material has a single fabric orientation which is

     weakly present in the coarse material.

</UL>


The latter category is the most interesting as it was unexpected in this

environment (either two overriding tills or a till and massive flow above).

The fact that the larger grain sizes are above the fine silts in each 'bed'

suggests these are not water formed features. While it is possible to

suggest that the units with this architecture were inverted in transport, a

progression can be found which supports a non-fluvial origin for these

features. Some areas show low strain fracturing of coarse units (fine

grained quartz bed?) into lenses along listric faults. In the more

developed features remnants of these can be seen

to bound the lens like external structure. This process causes the observed

juxtaposition of fine and coarse material.<P>



It can be suggested that free-water movement through the coarse beds away

from or to the particle reorientation zones of the listric faults allows a

single fault to form. This is in contrast to the post-faulting situation in

which flow is reduced along the coarse layer and stress leads to increased

pore water pressure / reduced effective pressure close to shearing areas

and, therefore, more pervasive movement / a wider shear zone. This provides

the pervasive movement necessary to give the 'graded' appearance of the

bed. The alternative is that these represent flow noses, with the larger

grains being extruded to the surface.<P>

<A NAME="syn">

<H3>Synthesis</H3>



There are a fixed number of possible environments for the formation of this

interbedded feature. These are combinations of...<P>

<UL>

<LI>lodgement till over run by another lodgement till or flow till,

<LI>post- or syndepositional formation,

<LI>the boulder effecting or not effecting its formation,

<LI>the possibility that the feature is glaciofluvial.

</UL>


Plainly there are a large number of possible processes that could form the

feature, however, on the basis of the sediments and the macroscale form

they have been whittled down to two...<P>



<B>Clast gouge and lodgement induced meltout.</B>

<OL>

<LI>The boulder gouges through the (older) lodgement till.

<LI>Pore pressure infront of the clast increases until the sediment

     yields or faults. Dewatering occurs and fluidized mud moves along

     clast caused microfaults and is extruded into the low pressure zone

     behind the clast. This is joined by till flows from the sides of the

     gouge. These processes formed the blue till layer above the resistant

     layer.

<LI>A combination of pore water removal or regelation refreezing and

     sediment compaction eventually lodge the clast.

<LI>The pressure of the ice on the clast causes pressure melt and water

     fills the gouge behind the clast. Meltout debris intermittently mixes

     with the reworked lower till. Smaller quartz grains rain out slower.

<LI>Lodgement of the upper till (the ice carried debris) continues.

</OL>


Problems - How do the aligned, clean, sand bodies form? I am loathed to

resort to ice frozen blocks of channel sand.<P>



<B>Pressure pumping of sediments.</B>

<OL>

<LI>Water pressure variations in distant till pump material from one

     lodgement till down shear zones and into the other lodgement till or

     the ice (for mechanism see <A HREF="#ref">Talbot and von Brunn, 1987</A>).

<LI>This mix of basal till and ice melts, fluids preferentially moving

     through and washing the sands. Quartz grains represent till bodies

     with fines removed where escape could not occur through sands.

</OL>


Macroscale fabrics make it unlikely that simple meltout without reworking

was a significant factor in the deposition of the whole of the upper till

and similar fabrics are not found anywhere else in the deposit. Therefore

my inclination is to the former of the two explanations though local

meltout may have been significant (see <A HREF="#ref">Boulton, 1977</A>). The amount of

meltout material in this case would be expected to increase as the clast became

lodged and, if we take the resistant layer seen in the field extending East from under the clast as a

consolidation trace of the path of the lower part of the clast, we see that

this is what happened. The ice pushing the clast East to West and lodged it

against a massive till lump, with meltout producing the mixed zone only in

the very last stages.<P>



In reference to the fluvial nature of the sediments it should be noted that

it is difficult to see how the lower lodgement till would be found in such

a prominence in the feature if it was formed simply from eroded layers of

the (overconsolidated) lower till combined with water born sands and

sediments in the early stages of flow slumping. One must also remember that

this feature is inextricably included in the lower lodgement till.<P>



This interpretation of the deposit could be strengthened or refuted through

an examination of the blue till above, below and within the resistant

layer, as the expected sediment changes in each area are easily estimated.<P>

<HR><P>
<A NAME="depo">

<H3>The Deposition Controversy</H3>



With further study this feature, and the other structures at the unusual

boundary between the two diamicts, should throw some light on the

controversial nature of the upper till. The inferences that can be drawn

from the work so far and avenues of further research are outlined below.<P>



<B>For one glaciation...</B>



The fact that the feature's silt and clay fabrics have not been altered

since deposition suggests that the feature has not been subjected to

glacial loading. However, the alignment of the sands (which might be

expected to dewater first under stress) may hint at loading. The sand

alignment would then be the equivalent of the small number of long shear

zones which cross sediment body boundaries in the thin sections. This could

be studied in a triaxial loading rig, comparing loading reorientation with

the observed fabrics.<P>



<B>For two glaciations...</B>



Boulton's model for the area relies on a vertical change in debris type up

through the ice to explain the difference in sediment between the lodgement

till and overlying flow till. The later was claimed to have partly melted

out of stagnant debris rich ice and partly formed of reworked lodgement

till. If it can be shown that the yellow material in the interbedded area

is the same as that above (and on the basis of the presently available thin

sections of both, there is nothing to suggest that it is not) there must

have been a horizontal change in the sediment at the very base of the ice

from the blue lodgement till to the yellow till above. In this structure it

can be seen that the ice was active when this sediment was deposited.

However, this is wild speculation and simple 'colour' is hardly a reliable

indicator of sediment type. It would be reckless to go any further than

this at present until the nature of the upper till and the yellow silts in

the mixed area can be examined in more accurate mineralogical detail.<P>
