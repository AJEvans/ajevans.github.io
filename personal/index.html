<H2>Field Experience</H2>

<P>
I enjoy fieldwork, especially the need to think on your feet and work 
with what you've got close to hand. I've worked on substantial projects in the following environments:

<LI>Central and Southern Iceland</LI>
<LI>Bellingshausen Sea, Antarctica</LI>
<LI>Swiss Alps</LI>
<LI>Nepalese mountain communities</LI>
</UL>
<P>
I've also been involved in a number of <A href="../teaching/index.html">fieldclasses</A>, most frequently in the Austrian Alps where I've taught 
glaciology and basic alpine skills.
