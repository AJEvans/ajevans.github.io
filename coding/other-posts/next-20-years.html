				<p><strong>Author: <a href="http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.evans/">Andy Evans</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In many respects, GeoComputation is a field whose time has come.</strong> If we take GeoComputation to be “The Art and Science of Solving Complex Spatial Problems with Computers”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>,
 GeoComputation is now the go-to area for both professional analysts and
 the public. 20 years ago, in 1996, when the field was launched with the
 first <a href="http://www.geocomputation.org/">international GeoComputation conference</a>
 in Leeds, UK, it was the passion of a few excited coders and 
geographers. Now, the analysis, visualisation, and use of spatial data 
is everywhere. It is therefore a great time to be reflecting on what the
 future holds for “GeoComp” – both as an academic subject, and more 
broadly within society. With this in mind, the community has been 
holding a number of events looking forward to the next 20 years in the 
runup to the next conference when the series will return to Leeds for a 
celebration and reflection.</p>
<p><strong>It seems clear, at least at the moment, that the next 20 years will be shaped by the growth of data.</strong>
 After years of bemoaning the lack of data for analysis and policy 
making, we now have vast amounts of information, albeit of varying 
quality and coverage, with which to understand the world and society. 
However, it seems worth reflecting on the nature of that data and how 
that nature will affect our community. <strong>With that data expansion 
we are also seeing a shift towards information different in two ways: 
the first difference is a shift towards immediacy as a time-frame, and 
the second is a shift to the individual as a unit of information.</strong> These changes bring some key opportunities, but also some key responsibilities for the GeoComp community.</p>
<p>These two changes to data are already playing out in people’s lives, in interlinked ways. <strong>This is particularly clear in the growing field of what we might call “bespoke individual policies”.</strong>
 For example, we have already seen the growth of car insurers offering 
reductions in premiums based on voluntary GPS tracking, along with 
healthcare insurers setting lower fees based on fitness-tracker activity
 profiles. Although such policies are generally not most obviously 
enacted by governments, they are frequently supported by governments as 
enacting worthwhile social adjustments (for example, by allowing 
flexibility in insurance regulations). This growth of quick-response, 
individual-level ‘opportunities’ is a more targeted, and therefore one 
might argue, more engaging system than aggregate policy making, and one 
that would seem increasingly popular in a neo-liberal capitalist milieu 
that is centred on personal responsibility and opportunity. And, infact,
 closer examination of government areas like the tracking and support of
 individual school pupils and the tackling of long-term unemployment 
shows that often the approach to target achievement by government 
departments is (at least nominally) to disaggregate support and tracking
 to the individual level. In part this is because it is generally the 
right location for support, but also to somewhat devolve failings to 
individuals not aggregate policy; in UK press rhetoric at least, the 
discussion is not about investment in areas, but in the failings of 
“problem families” and “skivers” – though in reality the area-based 
approach to investment continues in parallel. Finally, we have also seen
 the growth of algorithmic management in the so-called “gig economy”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>;
 zero-hour contracts and microworkers controlled at an individual level 
by algorithmic work policies. There are a great many tricky questions 
such a movement brings: can policies be automated, and to what time 
scale? What does it mean to vote for a long-term government, when 
policies are individual, bespoke, short-term, and commercially applied? 
These are questions to which a community with expert computational 
knowledge and a strong social understanding is well placed to 
contribute.</p>
<p>In many senses, GeoComputation should be keen to embrace the data 
changes at least. For years, we have struggled with two major 
statistical issues. The first is the Ecological Fallacy: the problem 
that we have previously needed to build policy around areas, not people,
 and that by doing so we have to assume that everyone in an area is 
represented by some prototypical description of what people in that area
 are like – if you live in an area where your neighbours all read a 
right-wing broadsheet newspaper, you too will, needs must, be treated 
like a right-wing broadsheet reader. The second is the Modifiable Areal 
Unit Problem (the “MAUP”): that aggregated statistics like averages 
change depending on where you draw area boundaries, as different groups 
of people are included in each area once drawn. Individual-level policy 
application and analysis seem like positive moves against these issues 
and ones we should embrace. In addition, <strong>individual level data 
brings greater nuance and understanding of lived experience, filling in 
the gaps of detail and coverage so long bemoaned in aggregate and yearly
 datasets.</strong> As such, it should contribute to better aggregate 
analysis and policy making as well as more individual-level 
applications. This doesn’t just apply to human geography: whether it is 
understanding people’s daily routines, or the territory of individual 
animals, or the way a rock moves within bedload, the shift to individual
 and instant data promises to help us understand the world and better 
contribute to solving the problems we see in it.</p>
<div id="attachment_149" style="width: 418px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://leedsbasic.wpengine.com/csapblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/128/2016/09/risk.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149" class=" wp-image-149" src="next-20-years_files/risk.jpg" alt="Census and daytime populations at risk from crime" width="408" height="262"></a><p id="caption-attachment-149" class="wp-caption-text">Census and daytime populations at risk from crime<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p></div>
<p>In that sense, one of the key improvements GeoComputation needs to 
make in the next 20 years is not only improved spatio-temporal pattern 
finding (what is the relationship between aggregates of things over time
 in space), but also how smaller elements fit into those larger 
patterns. Complex systems analysis has taught us that small changes at 
the individual level across a population can have big effects at the 
system level, but <strong>we have yet to develop the tools we need to 
track how individual-level behaviours induce ’emergent’ large-scale 
patterns, and link those scales through time (tracking both forwards and
 backwards)</strong>. Moreover, we need better tools for doing this in dynamic systems that are evolving before our eyes: <strong>we
 need methods and models that utilise the instantaneous reporting of 
many modern datasets, producing the kinds of short-term, high-quality, 
local analyses and predictions that could feed into more agile, 
responsive, (and potentially automated) policy-making</strong>; whether that be in responding to floods, local resource needs, or ecological protection.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think I’m alone in feeling ethically ‘queasy’ about this area, and <strong>it
 seems clear that the GeoComputational community has a shared 
responsibility to make sure that individual-level data is used to <em>enhance</em> individual freedoms while also supporting the development of a fair, supportive, and sustainable society more broadly</strong>
 – a balance that is surely a key issue in modern, if not most, 
civilisations. As the people developing and managing the foundations of 
many of these implementations, we need to be the group that points out 
the pitfalls of these techniques and keeps them from being tools of 
suppression and dissimulation.</p>
<p><strong>Traditionally, one of the dangers of the data-driven treatment of people is that we lose sight of individuals as human beings.</strong>
 To choose but two examples, Aly Gotz and Susanne Helm have shown the 
place of geographers and quantitative social scientists in the 
construction of the Holocaust, in part as a solution to population and 
land management in 1930s Germany<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>; while Geoffrey Bowker and Susan Star have shown the place of census statisticians in the apartheid system<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>.
 Nevertheless, I think most GeoComputational people are aware of this 
trend in the more everyday as well. Indeed, in some respects one of the 
potential positives of the shift to the individual data subject is that 
it responds to the demands of the “cultural turn” in geography during 
the 1970s and 80s, that geography needs to consider individual lived 
experience more. Nevertheless, it should be clear that simply 
concentrating on the individual does not relieve us of the potential 
that we might treat people as mere numbers, albeit smaller ones.</p>
<p><strong>A positive move in this respect, and one GeoComputation needs
 to highlight more, is what one might call the “cognitive movement” in 
quantitative geography.</strong> While much work in the field does treat
 individuals as numbers, there is also an increased interest in 
quantitatively capturing how people understand and interact with the 
world in a more nuanced fashion. The popular methodology of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model">Agent-Based Modelling</a>
 is generally constructed around a cognitive framework that encompasses 
Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions (plans). Equally, the vernacular and 
crowd-sourced understanding of the world is increasingly an important 
data area; with this understanding being extracted from social media and
 folksonomy (tag-based) datasets. <strong>This shift from “real” data to capturing and modelling <em>beliefs</em>
 about the world should let us concentrate on what people understand 
about objects and relationships in the world (what we might call a 
“doxastic geography”), and how they use those beliefs.</strong> This 
seems to me to be a key area of potential over the next 20 years, 
especially when it comes to GeoComputation contributing to issues of 
cross-cultural understanding, and the resolution of conflicts in 
resource use.</p>

<p><i>Percieved high crime areas vs real crime statistics. Users 
spraycanned a map with their beliefs about where crime was high and this

perceptions of crime were higher, in a very rough sense, than expected 
from average crime statistics.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></i></p>
</div>
<p><strong>More immediately, the GeoComp community also has a 
responsibility to see that new work is completed without repeating the 
mistakes of the past.</strong> Although it is clear that there is a 
growing use of data on us by companies, we have come a long way from the
 genuine era of the “data elite”, where a few select organisations had 
control over all data and it was impossible for anyone else to engage 
with information to argue their case. Increasingly the arguments over 
the way society manages the world are conducted not just <em>including</em> data, but with data as a medium and arena. <strong>When
 everyone has access to the tools we have taken an important role in 
developing, we have a responsibility to highlight what we have learnt 
about methodological issues and make sure the tools are used well</strong>, walking that delicate refereeing balance between highlighting some quite complex statistical issues (MAUP, <a href="http://gisgeography.com/spatial-autocorrelation-moran-i-gis/">Spatial Autocorrelation</a>;
 the Ecological Fallacy) while not acting as a pathway for suppressing 
debate. We also, as ever, need to continue to provide rigor to analyses,
 highlighting error and confidence limits. <strong>One key issue for the
 next 20 years is not only how we track emergence through dynamic 
systems, but also how we track error and confidence in specific evolving
 system components.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We also have a responsibility, in an increasingly immediate 
world centred on the individual, to point out three key issues: the 
first, that we have a history;</strong> that is, that the paths we have taken are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity">complex</a>,
 complicated, and fraught with difficulties, so we understand better the
 problems ahead of us, and not least because reflecting on one’s history
 is a key part of personal growth. <strong>Secondly, we need to open up the spaces where data can contribute to people’s wellbeing:</strong>
 we need to resist the temptation to concentrate on those datasets 
collected for and by companies and the government, and their associated 
uses, and show that data can contribute to improving people’s lives in 
areas beyond commercial and social management: in areas of leisure and 
pleasure; art and understanding; environment and health. <strong>Finally
 we need to fight to maintain some sense of society in a milieu that is 
increasingly individual-centred, despite economists and policy analysts 
increasingly crying the failure of purely market-centred approaches.</strong>
 We need to think through what duty people have to contribute data to 
the positive management of society while also ensuring that a world in 
which control is increasingly hell-bent on the individual-level responds
 fairly and agilely to people’s needs. This will involve avoiding the 
pitfall of assuming people never change; giving them the breathing space
 and anonymity necessary for personal growth and avoiding undue 
harassment; and embedding them within the aggregate responsibilities 
(and joys) we all have to support and create a better society. One of 
the many potential things lost in a concentration on the individual is 
the sense of duty and altruism that is key to running a fair, 
supportive, and sustainable society, and if all our concentration is on 
individuals, we risk losing sight of that to the detriment of current 
and future societies.</p>
<p><strong>For me, the GeoComputational community is well placed to 
contribute to these debates and build the tools necessary to negotiate 
these complicated issues.</strong> We have the computational background 
to build the numeric tools, but the humanistic background to understand 
how those tools affect people’s lives; we’re excited by the potential 
for data, but equally understand that data is neither perfect nor a 
complete representation; and we understand both the social issues at the
 heart of worthwhile data use, and also the statistical and application 
issues. It is easy to drop into partisan thinking on the data issue: 
either one is against individual-level instant data as encouraging “Big 
Brother”, or one is for it as an opportunity for the invisible hand of 
capitalism. I think, however, there is a middle ground; one where data 
supports the better understanding of society and the environment and 
fills many of the gaps in our previous knowledge, with uses that 
concentrate on solving key social and environmental issues. As it 
happens, this has generally been the space that the GeoComputational 
community has carved out for itself whatever the data, and I think this 
bodes well for the liveliness and relevancy of the community going 
forward. It is, in short, my hope that one major contribution the 
GeoComputational community can make over the next 20 years as data 
becomes more and more key to the way we live our lives, is to build and 
oversee the development of tools for a better, more supportive, and 
kinder society, a society that knows when data is important, and when it
 is not.</p>
