<P>
I've been involved in developing electronic learning materials since the early 90s: first on CD-ROM, then the Web. Here's a few of the materials I've 
developed that are currently online [now I've left the University of Leeds I'm afraid some of them have suffered a bit &ndash; at some point I'll probably replicate 
them elsewhere].
</P>


<H2>Getting started with programming:</H2>
<DL>
<DT><a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/materials/coding/introduction-schools/">Introduction to Programming</a></DT>
<DD>An introduction to computing I wrote for some primary teachers when the new UK primary computing curriculum kicked in, but hopefully good for anyone interested in learning about programming.</DD>

<DT><a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/materials/coding/kids-tech/">Good tech, coding software, and books for kids</a></D>
<DD>List of useful hardware, software, and other resources for primary children.</DD>


</DL>



<H2>Python</H2>

<DL>
<DT><A href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/materials/python/quickstart/">Quickstart Python</A></DT>
<DD>Quick introduction to Python, originally designed for the Leeds Data Science Society.</DD>

<DT><A href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python/">Programming for Spatial Analysts: Core Skills [Python]</A><BR />
<A href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-odl">{See also: slightly cut down distance learning version}</A></DT>
<DD>Introductory but fairly complete Python course for masters students on spatial analysis courses who have no programming experience. Practicals build up an agent-based model.</DD>

<DT><A href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/advanced-python/">Programming for Spatial Analysts: Advanced Skills [Python]</A></DT>
<DD>Follow-on for above basic courses, mainly dealing with library use, the development process, and the use of Python in ArcGIS - no audio track for lectures as they tend to change frequently.</DD>



</DL>



<H2>Java</H2>

<DL>
<DT><A href="http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/other/programming/core/index.html">Programming for Spatial Analysts: Core Skills [Java]</A></DT>
<DD>Introductory but fairly complete Java course for masters students on spatial analysis courses who have no programming experience. Practicals build up a basic mapping application.</DD>

<DT><A href="http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/other/programming/summer-school/index.html">Programming for Social Scientists Summer School [Java]</A></DT>
<DD>As above, but practicals build up an agent-based model.</DD>

<DT><A href="http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/other/programming/advanced/index.html">Programming for Spatial Analysts: Advanced Skills [Java]</A></DT>
<DD>Follow-on for above basic courses, mainly dealing with library use, the development process, and the use of Java in ArcGIS - no audio track for lectures as they tend to change frequently.</DD>

<H2>JavaScript / PHP / Web Based GIS / HTML</H2>

<DL>


<DT><A href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/other/web/writing/index.html">Introduction to writing webpages</A></DT>
<DD>A basic primer on writing your own webpages by hand using HTML. For more detail on how the web actually works, see the 
"Web Basics" lecture on <A href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python/part10/index.html">this webpage</A>.</DD>

<DT><A href="http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/postgrad/web/web-based-gis/">Web based GIS</A></DT>
<DD>Web-based Geographical Information Systems (mapping software) course for masters students. Not my course, but wrote the JavaScript, PHP, and Web and database security bits. How to put 
maps on the web.</DD>


</DL>



<H2>GitHub</H2>

<DL>

<DT><A href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/materials/github/quickstart/">Quickstart Github</A></DT>
<DD>Quick introduction to GitHub, originally designed for the Leeds Data Science Society. How to store in-progress software online and build free webpages.</DD>

</DL>




<H2>Computer modelling of the real world:</H2>

<DL>

<DT><a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/materials/scratch/disease-modelling/">Introduction to Computer Modelling for Secondary Students [Scratch]</a> <BR />
<a href="materials/scratch/disease-modelling/teachers.html">{Teachers' materials}</a></DT>
<DD>An introduction to disease modelling I wrote for secondary geography students and teachers. Uses the drag-and-drop language Scratch. Teachers' materials written with colleague Alison Heppenstall.</DD>

<DT><A href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/crime-modelling/">Techniques in Crime Modelling [Netlogo etc.]</A></DT>
<DD>Course put together for Trento University with colleague Nick Malleson. Includes a tutorial for the easy-use agent-based modelling software Netlogo.</DD>

<DT><A href="https://github.com/MassAtLeeds/FMF">Spatial Microsimulation</A></DT>
<DD>Short course on microsimulating synthetic populations, originally designed for West Yorkshire Police. The populations simulated have the statistical characteristics of 
real populations, but without individual-level data.</DD>
