<P>
One of the things we've had to deal with is what happens if 
we do something to leave the game. It's hard to construct nested if statements so that these all work properly. 
It would be better if we could just jump out of the game at some point.
</P>
<P>
To do this, we'll use a <EM>library</EM> - sometimes called a <EM>module</EM> in Python. Libraries are code other 
people have written that we can use. They are written in chunks called <EM>functions</EM>. We've seen two functions already: 
<CODE>print()</CODE> and <CODE>input()</CODE>. Functions always end in parentheses, which we can use to pass information 
into the function - for example, what to put on the screen. Some functions also return stuff to us which we can attach to variables - for 
example, <CODE>input</CODE> returns to us what the user has typed. 
</P>
<P>
These functions are part of a library built into Python, but most libraries you have to <EM>import</EM>. Let's look at how to do this.

At the very top of your program, put the following code:
</P>
<P>
<CODE>import sys</CODE>
</P>
</STRONG>
<P>
Once you've done this, you can use the "sys" system library. One function in the sys library stops the program running: "<CODE>exit()</CODE>". 
We can add the following code to any location where we'd like the user to leave the game:
</P>
<P>
<CODE>sys.exit()</CODE>
</P>
</STRONG>
<P>
Let's look at an example of where this might be useful...
