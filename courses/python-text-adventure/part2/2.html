<P>
So, hopefully that makes things a bit simpiler. We'll look at making things even easier to construct in the next part. 
For now, let's talk about monsters.
</P>

<P>
At the end of the last part, we left our game with a number of options like this...
</P>
<P>
<CODE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decision = input("You come to a junction. Turn left or right [L,R]: ")<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if decision == "L" or decision == "l":<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("You turn left and see a terrible ogre!")<BR />
</CODE>
</P>
<P>
But what is an ogre to do? Fight! That's what. But to fight, you need something to lose. 
Let's give our player some player_strength points. The player_strength will control how well they fight, but also they'll 
lose player_strength if they lose the fight. When they get to zero player_strength, they die. Let's give them 3 player_strength 
points to start with.
</P>
<STRONG>
<P>
At the top of your file, after the import statement, add the following code to set up a variable called player_strength:
</P>
</STRONG>
<P>
<CODE>player_strength = 3</CODE>
</P>
<P>
It's usual to add the main variables at the top of a program so they are easy to find. 
<P>
<STRONG>
Also add in another two import statements at the top of the file for a libraries we'll use later:
</STRONG>
</P>
<P>
<CODE>import random</CODE><BR />
<CODE>import time</CODE>
</P>
</STRONG>

<P>
Now let's look at the fight...
