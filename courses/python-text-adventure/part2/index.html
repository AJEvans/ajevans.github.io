<P>
In this part, we'll add in some monsters and fighting, as is traditional with dungeons. Save your story for the moment, and 
open up the file containing our game. At the end we'll talk about adding other characters to your game - they don't have to be 
monsters in your story - they could be unicorn sparkles to collect, or books, or the plague, or bicycles. But we'll 
use monster fighting as the example for the moment.

<P>
First, though, something to help make your code simpiler.
