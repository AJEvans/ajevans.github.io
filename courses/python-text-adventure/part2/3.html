<P>
Random elements in games include things like:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>where players <EM>spawn</EM> (start) in a landscape;</LI>
<LI>what attributes they have (like level of player_strength or wisdom);</LI>
<LI>where treasures to collect are;</LI>
<LI>how strong or cunning enemies are;</LI>
<LI>what level you go to next, and the design of levels;</LI>
<LI>the chances of events happening.</LI>
