<P>
One example of where this would be useful is at the start if they don't go into the mine:
</P>
<P>
<CODE>
decision = input("Do you want to enter? [Y,N]: ")<BR />
if decision == "N":<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Your quest is at an end, goodbye!")<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sys.exit()<BR />
else:<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("You enter the mines.")<BR />
print("The way is lit by candles on the wall.")<BR />
</CODE>
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Try adding this code to our game and check it works.</STRONG>
</P>
<P>
Note that when we use functions from libraries we need to use the <EM>dot operator</EM> "." - this means "look inside and find", so 
sys.exit() means "look inside the system library and find the exit() function.
</P>

<STRONG>
<P>
Go through and add exit() commands wherever you think they might be useful - but check and make sure the 
other options still work - one missed indent could have everyone exiting! You only need to do the "import sys" once, at the top of the file.
</P>
