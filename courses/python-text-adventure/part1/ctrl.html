One essential skill as a coder is to know <EM>keyboard shortcuts</EM>. These are 
key combinations that do specific jobs. The most common are pretty universal in all software, and involve 
holding down the <KBD>CTRL</KBD> ("control") key while pushing other keys.
</P>
<P>
Try selecting some text on this page by clicking at the start of the text and, while holding down the 
mouse button, dragging the mouse.
</P>
<P>
Now, without clicking with the mouse (which would unselect the text), hold down the <KBD>CTRL</KBD> key 
and, with it still held down, press the <KBD>c</KBD> key. This will copy the text.
</P>
<P>
Now go to your code editor, and click somewhere you can paste the text (e.g. after the code). Hold down the <KBD>CTRL</KBD> key 
and, with it still held down, press the <KBD>v</KBD> key. This will paste the text.
</P>
<P>
Finally, hold down the <KBD>CTRL</KBD> key 
and, with it still held down, press the <KBD>z</KBD> key. This will undo your changes.
</P>
<P>
Other combinations that are useful are:
</P>
<P>
<KBD>CTRL</KBD> + <KBD>a</KBD> : select everything.
</P>
<P>
<KBD>CTRL</KBD> + <KBD>x</KBD> : cut from page (also copies the cut stuff).
</P>
<P>
<KBD>CTRL</KBD> + <KBD>y</KBD> : do again (this is rarer, but most software has it).
</P>
<P>
<KBD>CTRL</KBD> + <KBD>s</KBD> : save the file.
</P>
<P>
If you're on Windows, the following are also useful:
</P>
<P>
<KBD>WINDOWS KEY</KBD> + <KBD>L</KBD> : lock the PC.
</P>
<P>
<KBD>WINDOWS KEY</KBD> + <KBD>r</KBD> : prompt to run software.
</P>
<P>
<KBD>WINDOWS KEY</KBD> + <KBD>SHIFT</KBD> + <KBD>s</KBD> : copy part of the screen by dragging the mouse (the <KBD>SHIFT</KBD> 
key is a fat arrow usually found either end of the second line up on a keyboard).
</P>

<P>
Most software uses the same keys - it would be very poor software design to make 
<KBD>CTRL</KBD> + <KBD>c</KBD> "delete everything", because everyone assumes it will be 
"copy" without checking. Keeping software working as people expect is a key element of 
<EM>usability</EM>: designing software that is easy to use.
