<P>
In these tutorials we'll write an old skool adventure game. You can use these games to explore all kinds of things, from 
walking round your neighbourhood during a historical time, to bringing your favourite book or film come to life, to helping 
people confront their fears or explore decisions they need to make. 
</P>
<P>
We're going 
to build a game set set in a dungeon - the kind of 
Dungeons and Dragons thing they played on Stranger Things. Even if you don't like fantasy games, work along 
for the moment; I promise, we'll come to making your own game later when you've got a clear idea of how they work. 
</P>
<P>
So, let's start our game. We already know the most important part: the "<CODE>print</CODE>" <EM>statement</EM>, which puts text on 
the screen:
</P>
<P>
<CODE>print("hello world")</CODE>
</P>
<P>
We call text in coding a <EM>string</EM> because it's a set of letters (or, as we call them, <EM>characters</EM>) strung together. We put the string 
we want printing in <EM>parentheses</EM> "()" after the print <EM>command</EM>. It's quite common to send information to commands by putting itt in parentheses like this. 
</P>
<P>
We can use print statements like this to tell a story.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Change your code so it prints "---Welcome to the game---".</STRONG>
</P>
<P>
Once you've got that working, move on to look at "print" in more detail...
</P>

<P>
One important thing to know about the print statement is that its string has to be all on one line. You can't do this:
</P>
<P>
<CODE>print("this is broken here<BR />
onto the next line and doesn't work!")
</CODE></P>
<P>
On the plus side, you can have very long lines if you like. Alternatively, you can do this:
<P>
<CODE>print("this is broken here " + <BR />
"onto the next line, but prints on one line!")
</CODE></P>
<P>
Or, if you want your text to print out on multiple lines, this:
<P>
<CODE>print("this is broken here")<BR />
print("onto the next line and prints on two lines!")
</CODE></P>
<P>
The plus "+" <EM>operator</EM> can join strings together ("<EM>concatinate</EM>" them).
</P>

<STRONG>
<P>
Get your code to print the following text (you can change the text to match your game idea if you like, or copy and paste this text):</P>
<P>
<CODE>After many days wandering the forest, you come across 
the entrance to what looks like a cave or mine - can this be what you are looking for? You've been told the golden crown lies in the depths 
of the old mines, guarded by a terrible beast.</CODE>
</P></STRONG>
<P>
If you struggle to make it work, check you've got double-quotes around the text inside the parentheses, that print statements don't break onto multiple lines 
without starting a new print statement, and that print is spelt correctly with no capitals.
