Did you manage it? Here's a version that works.
</P>
<P>
<CODE>
decision = input("Do you want to enter? [Y,N]: ")<BR />
if decision == "N" or decision == "n":<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Your quest is at an end, goodbye!")<BR />
elif decision == "Y" or decision == "y":<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("You enter the mines.")<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("The way is lit by candles on the wall.")<BR />
else:<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("A hole opens up below you, and you plunge into darkness. Goodbye!")<BR />
<BR />
</CODE>

So, we have one decision in our game! We need one more piece of information, and we'll be able to build a full 
interactive story...
