<P>
The whole program should now look something like:
</P>
<P>
<CODE>
name = input("Enter your name to start: ")<BR />
print("Welcome " + name)<BR />
print("After many days wandering the forest, you come across " +<BR />
"the entrance to what looks like a cave or mine - " + <BR />
"can this be what you are looking for?") <BR />
print("You've been told the golden crown lies in the depths " + <BR />
"of the old mines, guarded by a terrible beast.")
</CODE>
</P>

<P>
We can now:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Output a story to the screen.</LI>
<LI>Input information into the program.</LI>
<LI>Store information in variables.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
We need one more thing to make a basic game - some way of making decisions, or, as we call it in computing "<EM>selection</EM>"...
</P>
