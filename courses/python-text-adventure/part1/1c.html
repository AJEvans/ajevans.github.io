<P>
Let's see this in action. Below the line printing the welcome message, add new code to get your code to print the following text 
</STRONG>
(note that you can copy and paste the text if that helps - if you aren't sure 
how to do this using the keyboard, check out <A href="ctrl.html">this page</A>, which will teach you this essential 
coders' skill):</P>
<P>
<CODE>After many days wandering the forest, you come across 
the entrance to what looks like a cave or mine - can this be what you are looking for? You've been told the golden crown lies in the depths 
of the old mines, guarded by a terrible beast.</CODE>
</P></STRONG>
<P>
If you struggle to make it work, start by just printing "<CODE>After many days wandering</CODE>" and build it up. 
Check you've got double-quotes around the text inside the parentheses, that print statements don't break onto multiple lines 
without starting a new print statement, and that print is spelt correctly with no capitals.
</P>
