<P>
You should have enough now to start to pull together a story. Save what you've got for our game, because we'll come back to it to 
add some other characters. 
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Start a new file and have a go at your own game.</STRONG>
</P>
<P>
Your story doesn't have to centre on a dungeon - it could be something completely different; for example, you could write 
a story about your area set in a different time period (the plague! dinosaurs!), or you could bring your favourite film or 
book to life, or you could even write something to help a friend thing through a problem or help someone understand 
an issue like bullying - you can turn lots of things into these kinds of games.
<P>
Think through your whole game, but for the moment keep it quite short, or the 
nesting will get very complicated and you'll start to loose track, but you can probably get three or four levels of nesting 
to it (we'll deal with making this simplier but with more options as we go on - there's a trick we can use to avoid too much 
complicated nesting). 
</P>
<P>
Once you've got something you're happy with and you've experimented with nesting, go on to 
Part 2, where we'll add some more active monsters!
