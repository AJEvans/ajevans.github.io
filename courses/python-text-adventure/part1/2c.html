<div class="home">

<STRONG>
<P>
Change the code as below and try running the program again:
</P>
</STRONG>
<P>
<CODE>
name = input("Enter your name to start: ")<BR />
print("---Welcome to the game " + name + "---")
</CODE>
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>
Run the code and see what it does. 
</STRONG>
<P>
Whereas before we'd <EM>hardwired</EM> the name into the code (written it in), we now ask the user to <EM>input</EM> the 
name, and the program works for anyone. 
</P>
<P>
As an aside, note that we left a space after the <CODE>"start: "</CODE> - this just lays things out better for the user. Try removing the 
space to see what I mean.
</P>
