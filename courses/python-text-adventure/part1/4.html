<P>
Hopefully you got that working - if not, check the punctuation and indenting carefully.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>
When you've got this working, let's test it a little harder. Run the code, but try typing "n" (lowercase) and 
"G". How does it respond?
</STRONG>
</P>


<P>We'll come back to these issues. First, let's look at the code in more detail.
The code we've added uses an if-statement to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
<CODE>
decision = input("Do you want to enter? [Y,N]: ")<BR />
if decision == "N":<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Your quest is at an end, goodbye!")<BR />
else:<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("You enter the mines.")<BR />
print("The way is lit by candles on the wall.")<BR />
</CODE>
</P>
<P>
The "if" part is made up of the <EM>keyword</EM> "if" (keywords are special words built into the language), then 
a <EM>condition</EM>, i.e. something to check, and then finally a colon ":". The colon marks the start of a <EM>block</EM> 
of code that will happen if the condition is true; in our case, if the variable "<CODE>decision</CODE>" is equal to "<CODE>N</CODE>". This is 
the first indented block. 
</P>
<P>The "else" is the same, but it's block runs if the "if" condition isn't true. 
After the else-block we <EM>dedent</EM> the code, and the line 
<BR />
<CODE>print("The way is lit by candles on the wall.")</CODE>
<BR />
runs whether the condition is true or not.
</P>

<P>
There's a few things to point out about if-statements which will be of use when we think about the problems we found at the start of this page...
