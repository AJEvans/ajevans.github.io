In these tutorials we'll write an old skool adventure game. You can use these games to explore all kinds of things, from 
walking round your neighbourhood during a historical time, to bringing your favourite book or film come to life, to helping 
people confront their fears or explore decisions they need to make. 
</P>
<P>
We're going 
to build a game set set in a dungeon - the kind of 
Dungeons and Dragons thing they played on Stranger Things. Even if you don't like fantasy games, work along 
for the moment; I promise, we'll come to making your own game once we've got the core ideas down.

So, let's start our game. We already know the most important part: the "<CODE>print</CODE>" <EM>statement</EM>, which puts text on 
the screen:
</P>
<P>
<CODE>print("hello world")</CODE>
</P>
<P>
We call text in coding a <EM>string</EM> because it's a set of letters (or, as we call them, <EM>characters</EM>) strung together. We put the string 
we want printing in <EM>parentheses</EM> "()" after the print <EM>command</EM>. It's quite common to send information to commands by putting itt in parentheses like this. 
</P>
<P>
We can use print statements like this to tell a story.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Change your code so it prints "---Welcome to the game---".</STRONG>
</P>
<P>
Once you've got that working, move on to look at "print" in more detail...
