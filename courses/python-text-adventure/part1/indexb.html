<P>
If you managed to get the code running, great! You're a coder! It's a tradition in coding to start 
with "hello world" - and it's a useful tradition: this is the simplest code that 
shows that your system is running and you can get an <EM>output</EM> (information from your program to the wider computer or world).
</P>
<P>
If you didn't manage it, don't worry! Code has to be super-accurate: everything has to be exactly right - capitals and punctuation. 
If stuff doesn't work, make sure everything is typed exactly as suggested and try again: 
</P>
<P>
<CODE>print("hello world")</CODE>
</P>
<P>
We call the finding of problems in code <EM>debugging</EM> and errors <EM>bugs</EM>. If stuff doesn't work, don't worry - it 
doesn't mean you're a bad coder, it means you're a human being! No one, and we mean <EM>NO ONE</EM> can continually type 
perfect code - humans just can't do it. 80% of coding is finding bugs! 
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Even if your code ran properly, try adding an error - put a capital "P" on <CODE>print</CODE> or remove one of the 
double-quote marks. See how the system responds in the console. We'll see some error messages later, but see if you can work out some of what the 
system is saying when it spots a problem - reading these messages is a major part of being a coder!
</STRONG>
<P>
Right, let's get on with writing some code!
