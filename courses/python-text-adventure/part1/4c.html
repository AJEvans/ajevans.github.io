Secondly, note that we use "=" to assign a value to a variable, so we can't using for asking if two things 
are equal. Instead, in conditions, we use double-equals "==". It's a classic error to do this:
</P>
 <P>
<CODE>
if decision == "N":<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("This line done if condition true.")<BR />
<CODE>print("This line always done.")</CODE>
</CODE>
</P>
<HR>
<P>
Thirdly, note that we can check for more than one thing at once using the <EM>Boolean operators</EM> 
"<CODE>and</CODE>" and "<CODE>or</CODE>", which work like they do in English, so:
 <P>
<CODE>
if decision == "N" or decision == "n" :<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("This line done if either condition true.")<BR />
</CODE>
</P>
 <P>
<CODE>
if decision == "N" and name == "Alice" :<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("This line done if the user has typed N and their name is Alice.")<BR />
</CODE>
</P>
<HR>
<P>
Last, note that at the moment if the game ends, the code continues on, saying the way is lit by candles. 
If we put this inside the if-block that continues the game, we won't have this problem.
</P>
<P>
<CODE>
decision = input("Do you want to enter? [Y,N]: ")<BR />
if decision == "N":<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Your quest is at an end, goodbye!")<BR />
else:<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("You enter the mines.")<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("The way is lit by candles on the wall.")<BR />
</CODE>
</P>
<HR>
<P>
<STRONG>Can you write a better version of our current if-statement, which takes into account that users may type lowercase letters 
and letters that are neither Y or N?
