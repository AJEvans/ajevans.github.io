One important thing to know about the print statement is that its string has to be all on one line. You can't do this:
</P>
<P>
<CODE>print("this is broken here<BR />
onto the next line and doesn't work!")
</CODE></P>
<P>
On the plus side, you can have very long lines if you like. Alternatively, you can do this:
<P>
<CODE>print("this is broken here " + <BR />
"onto the next line, but prints on one line!")
</CODE></P>
<P>
The plus "+" <EM>operator</EM> can join strings together ("<EM>concatinate</EM>" them).
</P>
<P>
If you're happy with your text printing out on multiple lines, you can also do this:
<P>
<CODE>print("this is broken here")<BR />
print("onto the next line and prints on two lines!")
</CODE></P>

<P>
The last example gives us a key idea in coding. Programs are made of multiple lines of code in a <EM>sequence<EM>, one after another. 
Generally a 
computer will work from the top to the bottom of a page of code, unless told to do otherwise. We usually  
build up a program from the top to the bottom, at least when starting out.
