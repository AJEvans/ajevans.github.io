<P>
"Selection" is the process of making a choice in a program. This usually runs different code depending on the choice. You can 
think of it as splitting the code temporarily onto different paths based on the choice. Quite often, the paths will come back together 
fairly quickly.
</P>
<STRONG>
<P>
Add the following code after all your other code:
</P>
</STRONG>
<P>
<CODE>
decision = input("Do you want to enter? [Y,N]: ")<BR />
if decision == "N":<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Your quest is at an end, goodbye!")<BR />
else:<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("You enter the mines.")<BR />
print("The way is lit by candles on the wall.")<BR />
</CODE>
</P>
<P>
Note that three of the lines are <EM>indented</EM> (pushed across). Traditionally, this is done with four spaces. If you are using 
Spyder, and you push the <KBD>TAB</KBD> key on your keyboard, Spyder will add four spaces. 
</P>

<P>
See if you can get this code to run. Try running your code twice and entering "<KBD>Y</KBD>" and "<KBD>N</KBD>" to see the difference.
