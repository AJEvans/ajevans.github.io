<P>
Did you get it working? If not, here's a version that works:
</P>
<P>
<CODE>
print("After many days wandering the forest, you come across " +<BR />
"the entrance to what looks like a cave or mine - " + <BR />
"can this be what you are looking for?") <BR />
print("You've been told the golden crown lies in the depths " + <BR />
"of the old mines, guarded by a terrible beast.")
</CODE>
</P>
<P>
An important thing to know about code is that there isn't a single "right" answer - if it works, it works. 
If you have something different and it does what you want, that's great - you're in charge! 
</P>
<HR> 
<P>
This code is all very good, but it's not very personal. Let's add in the user's name. 
</P>
<STRONG>
<P>
Change the welcome message code at the start of the game so it looks like this, replacing "YourName" with your name in quotes:
</P>
<P>
<CODE>
name = "YourName"<BR />
print("---Welcome to the game " + name + "---")
</CODE>
</P>
</STRONG>
<P>
Note that <CODE>name</CODE> is not in quotes. 
</P>
<P>
Try running the program again. 
You should see your name in the welcome message.
