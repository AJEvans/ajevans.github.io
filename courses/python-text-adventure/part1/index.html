<P>
So, let's begin. Open up your Python editor. If you've installed Anaconda, the best one to open is 
Spyder. You should see something like this:
</P>

<P>
On the left is the code editor - you can see we've written some code in there. On the lower right is the console - this is where the 
program will write stuff or where error messages will appear - in this case, the program has run successfully and <EM>printed</EM> (written to the screen) "hello world". 
The green triangular button runs the code.

<P>
Let's build some code. First, delete your version of the code  below (it doesn't do anything we need to worry about yet):
</P>
</STRONG>
<P>
<CODE>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-<BR />
"""<BR />
Created on Wed May 20 14:20:40 2024<BR />

"""
</CODE>
</P>



<P>
<STRONG>
Then write the following in the code editor:
</STRONG>
</P>
<P>
<CODE>print("hello world")</CODE>
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>
and press the run button.</STRONG> 
</P></STRONG>
<P>
The words "hello world" should appear in the console, as in the picture above.

If it hasn't worked, we'll look at why in a second. In the meantime, move on to the next page:
