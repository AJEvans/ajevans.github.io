<P>
Hopefully you can see that this code is ultimately much easier to keep sensible that that 
using a whole load of if-else statements. We have a very short loop in <code>start()</code> 
which keeps looping round moving the player and checking to see what's at the current location. 
</P>  
<P>
Hopefully you're also starting to see how you could adapt the code to make it your own. 
You can add additional meaning to other numbers, so:
</P>
<P>
<code>friend_number = 5</code>
</P>
<P>
and...
</P>
<p>
<code>
if (map_data[current_y][current_x] == friend_number):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friend()
</code>
</p>
<p>
With a new "<code>friend()</code>" function to go with it.
</p>
<P>
You can edit the map in a text editor (open it up and have a look at it). I created it 
in Excel by putting a number in a square of cells and saving it as a ".csv" (Comma Separated Variables) 
file, which is on the drop down list of filetypes when you save an Excel file.
</P>
<P>
Give it a go adding some new numbers, walls (zeros), and functions; for example, you might 
like your player to find and collect some treasure, or lose lives in traps!
</P>
<P>
And with that, you should have made a great start on writing Python. We've covered:
<P>
variables<br>
if-else<br>
while loops<br>
functions<br>
lists<br>
There's a bit more to the core language, but not a lot. You've already learned more coding than 
they needed to  land people on the moon! Most of learning to code is then learning the different 
built in functions and functions supplied by other people. You're now at a very good stage for 
finding a good set of tutorials on the detail. A good starting point is 
the <A href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/">W3Schools</A> tutorials. Have fun!
