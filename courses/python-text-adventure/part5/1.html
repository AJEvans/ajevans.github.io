<P>
Rather than getting you to write all the code, I'm going to give it to you to get you started.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Download the following files into a directory you can find, and open the "game.py" in Spyder.
</STRONG>
</P>
<UL>
<LI><A href="game.py">game.py</A></LI>
<LI><A href="game.py">map.csv</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>
Before you run any code downloaded off the internet you should check at you can do one of at least two things:
<UL>
<LI>Check that you can find information about the person who wrote it and you'd be able to report them to 
a reliable police force if their code was malicious, or check that the code has been written by a company that 
would suffer massively if the code was unreliable.</LI>
<LI>You can read the code and check it isn't malicious.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Look at the code you've downloaded in Spyder - do you think it could do anything you wouldn't expect? Code to 
look out for is code that includes the following words:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>write</CODE>: is it writing anything odd to your harddrive?</LI>
<LI><CODE>read</CODE>: is it reading anything it shouldn't from your harddrive?</LI>
<LI><CODE>exec</CODE>: is it trying to run anything on your machine?</LI>
<LI><CODE>send</CODE>: is it trying to write something to the internet?</LI>
<LI><CODE>recv</CODE>: is it trying to receive something from the internet?</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Can you see any of these words in the code you've downloaded?
</P>
