<P>
In this part, we'll look at making <EM>functions</EM>. In some languages these are 
called <EM>sub-routines</EM>, <EM>methods</EM>, or <EM>proceedures</EM>, but they are all roughly the same thing: chunks of 
code separated off from the main program which you can <EM>call</EM> to do jobs for you, and which you 
can use as often as you like.

<P>
We've already seen a number of functions built into Python (e.g. the <CODE>print()</CODE> function) or from 
external libraries (e.g. the <CODE>random.randint()</CODE> function). Now we'll make our own.
