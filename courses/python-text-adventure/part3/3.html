So, this change has hopefully made our program much clearer - now we've just got one line that says "fight" when we fight - we've 
hidden away the rest of our code. This is one reason for functions - it makes it much easier to read programs. It's not 
unusual to see programs that look like this: 
</P>
<P>
<CODE>
read_data()<BR />
set_up_screen()<BR />
process_data()<BR />
display_answer()<BR />
</CODE>
</P>
<P>
However, there is another reason for using functions: they can be made reusable...
