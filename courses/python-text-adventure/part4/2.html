<P>
If you think it is that it doesn't work quite right for fights of one round, you're right! The code prints:
</P>
<P>
<CODE>fought it for 2 rounds</CODE>
</P>
<P>
when the number two is passed back, but for one it would print:
</P>
<P>
<CODE>fought it for 1 rounds</CODE>
</P>
<P>
The plural is wrong! It should be "round". Can you use a if-statement to 
fix this?
